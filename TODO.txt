Things to implement/fix
- Add a check in case of "missing symbol" in SPICE file. This should throw an ERROR!
- Start creating basic test to circuit_spice_parser. Pytest will be used
- Create a virtual environment [V] and update the whole project to python 3.12
- Add .toml file
- Update found vias and inbetween placed metal layers to JSON file after layout creation has completed.
- Handle bulks accidently overlapping for the diffpair of the original comparator circuit

- Maybe fix the fact that multiple connections to a port will show as the connection point being crated multiple times
  This is however correct behaviour since if a new cable is added and it needs to go to a layer not handled
