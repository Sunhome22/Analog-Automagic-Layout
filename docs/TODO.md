## Future improvements needed:
- [ ] Add support for digital cells. This will require speical handling throughout most of the program.
- [ ] Implement a post processing procedure that reduce the number magic file lines. 
      Rectangeles in the same layer can be grouped together 
- [ ] Use Pytest to create basic end-to-end tests for different circuits and configurations
- [ ] Auto placement of connection points on ports was a bad idea. This should be reworked and made more manual like its 
  done with vias for rails. 

## Notes
- Running unit_res_cap is not working.
