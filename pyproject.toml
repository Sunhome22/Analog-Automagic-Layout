# Linear optimization config options
# -> Alpha - Constant for weighing the importance of total Manhattan distance between components in the objective function
# -> Beta - Constant for weighing the importance of perimeter along the x-axis in the objective function
# -> Theta - Constant for weighing the importance of perimeter along the y-axis in the objective function
# -> Unit_width, Unit_height - Unit width and height are intervals of allowable placements along the x- and y-axis
# -> Offset_x, Offset_y - Minimum offset along the x- and y-axis between components that can not overlap
# -> Mirror - Boolean used for debugging. Turns on or off the mirroring constraint
# -> Run - Boolean used for debugging. Turns on or off the execution of linear optimization
# -> Stop_tolerance - MIP gap threshold percentage for when to stop searching with respect to the relative difference
#                     between primal and dual solutions
# Tip: If all components are the same size set unit height and width to the size of the components
